=head1 HISTORY

This creature first came to life sometime between 2000 and 2001.  At the time, there was nothing
available that really suited my needs, so I wrote what I wanted :)  Voodoo has been in use and 
refinement by myself and a small group of my collegues ever since.  It has always been my intent
to release this thing into the wild, but I could never seem to find the time to clean up a few
ugly parts and write all the much needed documentation.
