Apache::Voodoo 1.10
=================

Apache Voodoo, or just Voodoo for short is a web based applicate framework
for Apache 1.3 and mod_perl.  It's goal is to handle all the repetitious and 
sometimes tricky/difficult mod_perl stuff for you.  By nature, it enforces
a clean division of presentation (HTML), logic (your Perl code), and 
Apache/mod_perl.

Some features include:

    * Abstraction of mod_perl and apache interaction away from the user's code
    * Separation of presentation and logic via HTML::Template
    * Dynamic reloading of modules upon change(bypass-able for production sites)
    * Automatic session management
    * Automatic database connection and persistence
    * Powerful database abstraction system vi L<Apache::Voodoo::Table>
    * Simple enough API that the learning curve is pretty shallow
    * Integrated debugging tools
