1.22 - 12/18/2006
================
Bug fixes.

1.21 - 11/27/2006
================
Bug fixes, improved handling of the apache configuration paths.

1.20 - 02/07/2006
================
Added automated install / upgrade process of Voodoo based sites (see voodoo-control for details).
Unfortunately to make this work cleanly, I had to introduce a backwards-incompatibility.  The
layout of a site is no longer completely arbitrary as it was before, certain things are expected
to reside in certain locations.  Completely arbitrary layouts yielded no real benefit, made the docs
more complex thus raising the initial learning curve, and introduced needless complexities
and hoop jumping.

Loads of bug fixes:
	AV::Table is no longer destructive to the incoming configuration structure.

	Made history capture only operate on GET requests.  Capturing POSTs can lead to bad things
	happening if you happen to redirect back to a posted history event...same thing applies
	for PUTs.  The side effect is that you now need to be more careful with your form method settings,
	which we all should be doing anyway :)

1.13 - 9/15/2005
================

Works with DSO builds of mod_perl.  The PerlRestartHandler isn't called the same way with ia DSO vs build in version of mod_perl

abstracted pagination control object (Apache::Voodoo::Pager)

various bug fixes

1.1.2 - 2/13/2005
=================

Again with the documentation indexing thing.

1.1.1 - 2/11/2005
=================

search.cpan.org didn't wanna play nice with my documentation...hopefully this fixes it.

1.1.0 - 2/11/2005
=================

First public release.

1.0.x
================

Historic, non-public releases.  I have them if anyone is interested, but they are not
backwards compatable with the current release
