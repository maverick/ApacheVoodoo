Apache::Voodoo::license - License Terms for Voodoo

=head1 Preamble:

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which the Package
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of 
artistic control over the development of the Package, while giving the users of
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable derivative works.

=head1 Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the consent of the Copyright Holder. 

"Copyright Holder" is Steven Edwards. 

"You" is you, if you are thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 

"Reasonable Copying Fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the Package itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the Package. It also means that
recipients of the Package may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it. 

1.    You may make and give away unmodified verbatim copies of the source form
      of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
      you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
      disclaimers.

2.    You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
      from the public domain or from the Copyright Holder.  If the Package is
      modified in this way, it shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3.    You may otherwise modify your copy of the Package in any way, provided
      that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
      when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
      following:

  a)    place your derivative works in the public domain or otherwise make
        them Freely Available, such as by posting said derivative works to
        Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the derivative works on a
        major archive site such as ftp.uu.net or cpan.org, or by allowing the
        Copyright Holder to include your derivative works in the Standard
        Version of the Package.

  b)    use a derivative Package only within your corporation or organization.

  c)    rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
        standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
        separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
        documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

  d)    make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4.    You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
      executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a)    distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
        together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
        to get the Standard Version.

  b)    accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
        Package with your derivative works.

  c)    accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
        Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
        names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or 
        equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
        Version.

  d)    make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5.    You may charge a reasonable Copying Fee for any distribution of this
      Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
      You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may
      distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) 
      programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution 
      provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6.    The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
      from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
      copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may
      be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7.    C or Perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall
      not be considered part of this Package.

8.    The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
      products derived from this software without specific prior written
      permission.

9.    THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTABILITY FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
      IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY
      KIND ARISING OUT OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER USE OF THE PACKAGE.
