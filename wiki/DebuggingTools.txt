---+!! Debugging Tools
%TOC%

---++ Backend Configuration
Apache::Voodoo currently supports 3 different debugging backends, a built in "Native" backend, <nop>FirePHP, and Log4perl.
Each controlled via the =<debug>= block in the applications =etc/voodoo.conf= file.  Each have different configuration rules and requirements as described below. 
You're not restricted to picking just one, you can use any combination of them in any configuration you like.

---+++ Native
Native debugging uses a separate logging daemon capture debugging messages to either to a SQLlite or <nop>MySQL database. 
A separate Apache handler handles the display of the captured data.

---++++ Initial Setup
This only needs to be done once for all applications that want to use the Native debugging backend.
---+++++ Configure Voodoo
First Apache::Voodoo needs to be told where the debug database is going to stored.  Execute =voodoo-control setconfig= and set the values
of =Debug DB Connection=, =Debug DB Username=, =Debug DB Password=, and =Debug URL Path=.  The first three are the parameters
are passed to =DBI->connect= to establish the connection the debugging database.  =Debug URL Path= tells the debug panel where on the server 
the debug handler is setup.  For example:

<verbatim>
Debug DB Connection: dbi:SQLite:dbname=/tmp/apachevoodoo.db
  Debug DB Username:
  Debug DB Password:
     Debug URL Path: /debug
</verbatim>

uses a local SQLite database to store the debugging information.  If you use <nop>MySQL for storage, give each instance of Apache its database;
 don't try sharing the same one.

---+++++ Start the logging daemon.
Start the logging daemon by executing =voodoo-daemon start=, it should be in the same directory as =voodoo-control=.  Be sure to 
do this *before* you start Apache, or at the very least before the first request.  The Native debugging module will automatically disable itself if it can't contact
the logging daemon.

---+++++ Configure Apache
In your =modperl-startup.pl= add
<verbatim>
use Apache::Voodoo::Debug::Handler;
$Apache::Voodoo::Debug = Apache::Voodoo::Debug::Handler->new();
</verbatim>

If you have multiple vhosts running Apache::Voodoo add the following block *outside* of the vhost configuration to enable it for all the vhosts
at once.  If you only have one vhost running Apache::Voodoo then place this inside the vhost configuration block so that it is only 
enabled for that vhost.

<verbatim>
<Location /debug>
        SetHandler modperl
        PerlResponseHandler $Apache::Voodoo::Debug->handler
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        Deny from none
</Location>
</verbatim>
The location here *must* match the setting of =Debug URL Path= in =voodoo-control=.

*Note:* you can set the =Order=, =Allow=, and =Deny= params to whatever is appropriate for your environment.

---++++ Configuration Options
Each of the following flags controls the display of the output from their corresponding functions.
   * =debug= = *(0|1)*
   * =info= = *(0|1)*
   * =warn= = *(0|1)*
   * =error= = *(0|1)*
   * =exception= = *(0|1)*
   * =table= = *(0|1)*
   * =trace= = *(0|1)*

   * =profile=  *(0|1)* - enables or disables the display of the timing messages produced by the =mark()= function.
   * =params= =  *(0|1)* - enables or disables the display of the URL parameters or form post variables.
   * =return_data= = *(0|1)* - enables or disables the display of the data returned from each controller.
   * =template_conf= = *(0|1)* - enables of disables the inclusion of the =$p->{template_conf}= as passed to the controller.
   * =session= = *(0|1)* - enables of disables the display of the contents of the session store at it exists at the end of the request.

Setting =all= to 1 is a shortcut for turning on everything.

Example:
<verbatim>
<debug>
        <Native>
                debug  = 1
                info = 1
                warn  = 1
                error  = 1
                exception = 1
                table  = 1
                trace  = 1

                profile = 1
                params  = 1
                return_data  = 1
                template_conf  = 1
                session = 1
        </Native>
</debug>
</verbatim>

---+++ <nop>FirePHP
Once you have installed the [[http://www.firephp.org][FirePHP plugin for Firefox]], this backend will make your debug messages appear in your browser.  If you don't have the plugin installed, enabling this backend has no noticeable effect.

Each of the following flags controls the display of the output from their corresponding functions.
   * =debug= = *(0|1)*
   * =info= = *(0|1)*
   * =warn= = *(0|1)*
   * =error= = *(0|1)*
   * =exception= = *(0|1)*
   * =table= = *(0|1)*
   * =trace= = *(0|1)*

Setting =all= to 1 is a shortcut for turning on everything.

Example:
<verbatim>
<debug>
        <FirePHP>
                debug  = 1
                info = 1
                warn  = 1
                error  = 1
                exception = 1
                table  = 1
                trace  = 1
        </FirePHP>
</debug>
</verbatim>

---+++ Log4perl
%STARTSECTION{"Log4perl"}%
Once [[CPAN:Log::Log4perl][Log::Log4perl]] has been installed, the Log4perl backend can be enabled by adding a =<Log4perl>= configuration inside the =<debug>= block in your application's =voodoo.conf=.  The contents of that block are treated as the configuration file for Log4perl.
Since Log4perl creates a single instance of itself for Apache, as opposed to an instance for every application, it is important to make sure that each Log4perl configuration does not effect the configuration of another.

Example:
<verbatim>
<debug>
        <Log4perl>
                log4perl.logger.test = TRACE, testfile
                log4perl.appender.testfile = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
                log4perl.appender.testfile.filename = /tmp/test.log
                log4perl.appender.testfile.layout = Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
                log4perl.appender.testfile.layout.ConversionPattern = %p [%d] %c: %m%n
        </Log4perl>
</debug>
</verbatim>

Would enable all logging messages for the =test= application.  You can control what things get logged based on the name of the package.  For example if you have a modules named =Foo::Bar= and =Foo::Baz= then
<verbatim>
log4perl.logger.Foo.Bar = INFO, testfile
log4perl.logger.Foo.Bar = ERROR, testfile
</verbatim>
would log everything =info()= and above from =Foo::Bar= (and its subclasses) and everything =error()= and above from =Foo::Baz= (and its subclasses).

It is important to be aware of how the names of Voodoo's debugging methods correspond to the logging levels in Log4perl.
| *Voodoo* | *Log4perl* |
| trace | TRACE |
| debug | DEBUG |
| table | DEBUG |
| info | INFO |
| warn | WARN |
| error | ERROR |
| exception | FATAL |

This is only a small example.  Log4perl is a very flexible and powerful system, please see the [[http://mschilli.github.com/log4perl/][Log4perl website]] for details.

---++ Methods
With the exception of =exception()=, these methods silently do nothing if debugging is not enabled.  Further, the methods all behave the same way regardless of which backends are enabled, or how they are configured.  Thus you are free to use any of these in your code without any concern for how debugging has been configured.

---+++ debug(), info(), warn(), error()
Each of these take any number of parameters and produces a debug message. They each use [[CPAN:Data::Dumper][Data::Dumper]] internally so you can pass it any type of parameter.

Examples:
<verbatim>
$self->debug("The contents of $p is:",$p);
$self->info("What's in this object?",$some_object);
$self->warn("Something is suspicious in here",\@some_array,\%some_hash);
$self->error("Something went wrong:",$!);
</verbatim>

---+++ exception($string)
 Causes these immediate termination of the running program. Displays a stack trace with =$string= as the error message.

<verbatim>
$self->exeception("You can't have cake! You didn't eat your pudding.");
</verbatim>

---+++ trace($string)

Displays a stack trace of the running program using =$string= as the description. The effect is similar to =exception()= except that it does *not* cause the program to terminate.

---+++ table($string,$array_ref)
If you're trying to examine the contents of a sql result set, or and array-of-arrays, it is often helpful to view that as a grid instead of the format that [[CPAN:Data::Dumper][Data::Dumper]] produces.  =table()= does just that.  The first parameter sets the caption on the table, the second is the data to display.

Example:
<verbatim>
my $res = $p->{dbh}->selectall_arrayref("SELECT foo, bar, baz FROM qux");
$self->table("data from qux",$res);
</verbatim>
